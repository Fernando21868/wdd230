          On the main page of Amazon, we can see the different topics that
          Amazon offers, as well as on this page they offer products for sale.
          Each of these topics, apps, or products for sale, is accompanied by a
          textual description, review, image, price in some cases. Each of the
          features appears to the right of the main image, in close proximity to
          the image it describes. You can easily differentiate how each group is
          slightly separated from the other groups, but at the same time they
          form a whole, which are separated even more differently from the
          header, comments, or footer. In this way each related items should be
          grouped close together. This provides the viewer with a visual cue
          that these items are similar and should be treated as a group.

        <h2>Contrast</h2>
        <p>PlayStation Store</p>
        <a href="https://store.playstation.com/" target="_blank"
          >store.playstation.com</a
        >
        <div>
          <img
            src="images/playstation.jpg"
            alt="The main page of PlayStation, or home page of PlayStation, where items and topics are seen."
            width="200"
            height="400"
          />
        </div>
        <p>
          On the main page of PlayStation Store, a little below the offers, you
          can see some topics such as the new console, games, discounts, etc.
          These are general items that can be accessed to see more in detail
          what it contains. In this way you can see a great difference with the
          rest of the page, because there is a great contrast between the white
          and blue color of the main page, and the black color for the general
          topics. Therefore, what is represented here is that thanks to contrast
          it is easy to make dis-similar elements very different. Contrast is
          one of the most powerful visual design tools. This can be seen
          throughout the PlayStation page, because they also use the color blue
          to focus people's eyes on the subscribe button. Also, many times they
          make offers to the public, and these offers are normally yellow, a
          totally different color from the one used by PlayStation but that
          helps to differentiate it from other items.

        <h2>Alignment</h2>
        <p>Booking</p>
        <a href="https://www.booking.com/" target="_blank">Booking.com</a>
        <div>
          <img
            src="images/booking.jpg"
            alt="The main booking page, or booking home page, where you can see offers, topics, hotels, lodging."
            width="200"
            height="400"
          />
        </div>
        <p>
          On the main page of booking.com you can see that the alignment of the
          items, hotels, user registration page as seen in the image, is aligned
          correctly, and there is a connection between them. The topic of
          hotels, lodgings, offers are correctly aligned. When you enter to see
          a particular hotel, the characteristics of the hotels, such as the
          description, score, reviews, comments, are correctly aligned, the
          texts can be read clearly and smoothly, and it is not appreciated that
          any element is poorly designed, or misaligned with respect to the
          other elements. This way every visual element on this page has some
          kind of connection to at least one other element. Nothing is
          positioned haphazardly.
